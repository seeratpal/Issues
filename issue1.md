# issue 1

One of the most problematic settings that can cause slow boot times in Windows is the fast startup option. This is enabled by default and is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off.

To disable fast startup, open Windows Search with the Windows key on your keyboard and type "control" to open the Control Panel. In the resulting window, change the View by item at the top-right to Small icons, then select Power Options.

Next, click Choose what the power buttons do on the left sidebar. You'll need to provide administrator permission to change the settings on this page, so click the text at the top of the screen that reads Change settings that are currently unavailable.

Now, untick Turn on fast startup (recommended)

Using Microsoft ScanDisk and Defrag or similar disk utilities help verify your hard drive is running free of errors while organizing stored data in the most efficient manner possible. We suggest running both utilities at least once every few months.
