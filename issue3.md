A software application may crash right after you launch it, sometimes because it needs to get the operating system date. The operating system may use a corrupt preference file and as a result will not respond properly to date requests. A solution is to set the system date again from 'System Preferences > Date & Time', change any setting, save, revert the change and save again.
